# Chinese Pronunciation Searcher

Under developing.

## Usage

`npm install`  
`npm run server.js`

## This Project

On the front-end,

- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
